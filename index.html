      <h1>How I Fell In Love California:My Story</h1>
      <p>I started to travel out of California in the year 2023. I was going through a huge transition period in my
        life.
        I
        ended an almost 9 year relationship with someone I thought I could trust for life. I was heartbroken. So, I
        picked
        up the broken pieces of myself and started to travel over to the West Coast to visit my very dear friend Becca.
        I
        always have the time of my life out there. Between 2023-2024 I flew out to the West Coast more than several
        times.
        Mainly in the summer and major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. I almost never want to come back to
        NYC.
        If I had the financial baking I would've moved out there some time ago. One day I would like to do just that.
