  <h1>The History of Muay Thai In America</h1>
  <p>Muay Thai has a history of being in America since the mid-20th century. American service men that had been
    stationed in Thai Land encountered it Muay Thai and we're awe struck by its intense nature and disciplined skills.
    According to website of the <a href="https://thaiboxing.com"> Thai Boxing Association of the U.S.A.</a>, the
    history
    of Muay Thai in America started in the year 1968, when Kru Ajarn Chai came to the United States. Chai, reputedly,
    was
    the first-ever Thai boxing instructor to teach Americans the art.
